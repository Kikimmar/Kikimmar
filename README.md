## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
## My name is Max Bolduresku.  
In 2023, I participated in the selection of School 21 from Sberbank, but did not continue to study there.  
To date, I am studying full-time in the evening at the "Information Technology Training Center" of Novosibirsk State Technical University (NSTU), specializing in "COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS SOFTWARE".  
I have been doing self-studying for two years, I devote all my free time to learning the C++ programming language, I study the Qt framework.  
At the moment, I am looking for a vacancy for the position of a developer at the "Intern" or "Junior" level for accelerated training not only in my free time, but also during my professional activity.
